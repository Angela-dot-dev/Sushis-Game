Pet Pet Pet! So nice, she always knew that spot.
You end up climbing on her lap as she says something incomprehensible for you, she looks... kinda sad.
You begging thinking... didnt a black suit man came in last night?
Could had him hurt her? Leo is old, or at least "old looking" for you, so maybe she was attacked for being... weak?
White hair, slow movements, all that, she must be pretty old for a human...
You? You are only about 6 months old and ready to play! But not right now.
For now, pets! And thats the only thing that matters.
You end up falling asleep, you wake up a couple of hours later.
