You wake up the cat, her name is Sushi. And you are her owner.
Well, you were her owner, you will now be Sushi herself!
Welcome to Sushi's Tiny Adventure! 
Sadly you have just had been woke up from your ever so pleasant sleep.
Your owner, Leo, tries to scratch the back of your ear.
--Path one Q1
Pet Pet Pet! So nice, she always knew that spot.
You end up climbing on her lap as she says something incomprehensible for you, she looks... kinda sad.
You begging thinking... didnt a black suit man came in last night?
Could had him hurt her? Leo is old, or at least "old looking" for you, so maybe she was attacked for being... weak?
White hair, slow movements, all that, she must be pretty old for a human...
You? You are only about 6 months old and ready to play! But not right now.
For now, pets! And thats the only thing that matters.
You end up falling asleep, you wake up a couple of hours later.
-- Path two Q2
You aren't up for pets right now, you were just having such a pleasant dream!
You close your eyes as you try catch your sleep again...
You end up dreaming about your other brothers and sisters, it wasnt to long ago since they took them away from you.
Every time an stranger came, they took one of them from you and your mom.
Your mom couldnt take it, so she ran away to search them.
She will be back eventually, still, you kinda miss her.
Gwah! To much sadness, you dont want sad dreams, you wake up.
